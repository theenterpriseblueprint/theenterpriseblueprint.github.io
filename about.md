  Hey there! Thanks for visiting. Here's a little more about me.
</p>

I’m Archit Bhise and I’m interested in enterprise software and business problems that drive large impact within organizations. I'm currently a first-year MBA student at the [Harvard Business School](http://hbs.edu).

I’m interested in first principle approaches to solving problems and am a [big fan of people who disagree with me](http://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/).

In a previous life, I was a venture capitalist focused on investing in startups in Silicon Valley at [Redpoint Ventures](http://redpoint.com) and sold software to Fortune 500 strategic accounts at [Mulesoft](http://mulesoft.com). I also founded an enterprise software startup called [Wellframe](http://wellframe.com) and served as the Chief Product Officer. We built software that uses artificial intelligence to help high-risk patients recover from complex diseases - like heart attacks, organ transplants, COPD - and helped insurers improve patient care.

Quick academic background: I graduated from [MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) and I've previously worked with [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/tem/).

I’m always up for a coffee to find out more about interesting problems facing the enterprise, so feel free to get in touch!

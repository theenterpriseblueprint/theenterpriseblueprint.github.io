title: Introducing the Enterprise Blueprint
---

Enterprise software is a space that is tackling some of the most interesting problems we face in the world today - complex coordination, real-time metrics, decision-making powered by artificial intelligence, and more. Businesses are being forced to operate at a speed faster than ever before and with that comes the need for a different, more powerful toolset that helps the stars - the people that run those businesses - operate smarter, more efficiency and more effectively.

### A new kind of interview series

The Enterprise Blueprint is an homage to those operators on the frontline seeing different business problems, understanding the various approaches possible and then driving change from within. Here, I seek to understand how those heroes:

* Make decisions about which problems they solve
* See what challenges lie ahead
* What keeps them up at night
* What great software that changes their worldview looks like
* How to enable them to succeed
* What truly matters to them and their business

### Why

I believe enterprise software is truly going to change the world. AWS has made it possible for anyone anywhere to deploy a website in a matters of seconds. Salesforce has revoluzioned the way we think about customer success. Stripe is making it easy to ensure even the smallest of businesses have the same amount of liquidity that enterprises have. However, I think this is still 'Day 1' for enterprise software.

There will be more problems that software will able to solve and I want to talk to people on the front lines who are seeing their business evolve everyday.
